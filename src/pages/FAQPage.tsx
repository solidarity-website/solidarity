            As defined in the Regulation 2(o) of SEBI(Portfolio
            Managers)Regulations, 2020, a portfolio manager is a body corporate,
            which, pursuant to a contract with a client, advises or directs or
            undertakes on behalf of the client (whether as a discretionary
            portfolio manager or otherwise) the management or administration of
            a portfolio of securities or goods or funds of the client.

        q: "Why should an investor select a PMS over a Mutual Fund?",
        a: (
          <>
            <p>
              Unlike a mutual fund, PMS gives access to ownership in individual
              shares. PMS works on the concept of personal demat, whereas mutual
              funds offer units in the pooled portfolio. In PMSs, one investor's
              behavioural reactions to market movements don't impact other
              investors' portfolios. Portfolio Managers have the flexibility
              with regards to allocating corpus per business, per sector, and
              cash calls.
            </p>
            <p>
              PMSs are more focused, concentrated, customised as per clients
              requirements i.e not investing in the restricted stocks given by
              the clients and follow relatively lower churn, as funds do not
              flow in and out too often as in the case of a pooled structure
              like MF. PMSs are more transparent in terms of activity,
              transactions, holdings, expenses, and so investors are more
              connected and informed about where the money is eventually
              invested.

            plan for a minimum investment horizon of 3 to 5 years, and the
            longer the horizon, the better. For those with an investment
            timeline shorter than 3 years, we recommend seeking alternative

              client's start time with us, as well as any subsequent funds added
              or withdrawn. While incrementally we take similar decisions for
              our clients, for a new client, their portfolio at the time of
              entry may appear quite different from that of an existing client.
              This difference is also influenced by the current valuations of
              the companies we are looking to invest in. If valuations are
              attractive, we invest more promptly; however, if they are less so,
              the process of becoming fully invested may take longer, sometimes
              even several months.
